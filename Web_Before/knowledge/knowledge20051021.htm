But its calculation abilities don't even match a modern laptop computer. After the birth of transistors, the size of computer gradually become smaller and its calculation abilities increased by many folds. At this time, software became more complex, various computer programming languages started to appear. To make programs easier to manage, designers divided programs into pieces, called procedures or functions. Each procedure or function has an interface that can allow the caller to pass in and receive information after the procedure or function has been executed. But this method of division is mainly focused on control and operation. However, the data was still shared. Therefore, when computer speed multiplies every 18 m onths, the size and complexity of programs also grew. How to modulate program design and improve the rate of reusability has become an important topic. At this time, the Object-Oriented design concept has been developed to solve this problem. The so called object is to package the data and procedures into a basic unit, making object the basic unit of managing and reusing, this avoiding the line to line search of programming code to modify programs or data structure. </p></td>

The structure of programs evolved from client/server, 3-teir and evolved into an n-tier MVC architecture. Between the complex system architecture are millions of program objects. The only way to manage such a complex system is to apply objected-oriented concepts, to package a larger program into a basic unit, and define a set of standards to call each basic unit through the internet. This is the basics of SOA, these basic units in SOA are called services. </div></td>

              <div align="justify">To understand SOA, it must be known first the meaning of “service”. Different systems have different definitions and demand for services. From a feature point of view, service can be a simple foreign exchange rate conversion to a complex credit card transaction system. From a technical point of view, a service needs to have an Application Programming Interface and protocol. Service oriented architecture is a service based distributed processing architecture. It has three mandatory components: service provider, service request system, and service catalog. A system built upon SOA is itself is a requestor, it finds service providers that can meet its needs using the service catalog, and use standardized methods to make requests to the services. For example an accounting system that can calculate foreign exchange rates in real time can find all the foreign exchange services from the service directory environment, and filter the required foreign exchange service providers. Then this system can communicate and request service from the service providers through standard protocols. The service requestor (the accounting system) can also be a service provider, providing though various combinations of services to other systems (such as ERP) specialized services. Therefore services are like building blocks; where small services can be grouped together to form larger services, then all these services can form a complete system. </div></td>

Aside from these more complete architecture technology, there are technologies focused on data exchange structure and protocol. We refer to them as Service Based Architecture, such as Rosetta Net is representative of this type of technology. But while these technologies have been around for many years, it has not attracted the attention of most people. The main reason is that these technologies are often limited in the scope where it can be applied and the technology barrier is too high, making it difficult to learn. </div></td>

Also, standard technologies such as HTTP and XML have all became mature, enabling Web Services to gain more attention. The strength of Web Services is that it is not limited, from PC computers to large mainframes and from VB to Java, can all communicate with each other. Tools to create services and use services have become more mature, making the barrier of entrance much lower. In addition, with the promotion of major software providers, it has become more popular than ever. </p></td>

These three standards define, respectively, transfer protocol, information required for service directory, and service as well as description of services. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) regulates that information transfer can be conducted through the internet using the standardized HTTP or SMTP protocols, and the data formats, including MIME and XML, are all defined in detail. So a service requestor can generate a SOAP request for the service provider. The results of the service can also be transferred to the requestor through SOAP. But for a requestor to find a provider, it must find the provider through a directory. Such as when we use the 104 directory service. UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) provides a service for providers of various services to register their services on so requestors can find service providers and their information, including the types of company information provided and service information. The service description is provided in the WSDL (Web Service Description Language) format that defines the features provided by the service, such as API concepts, and describes the input and output data types. </p></td>

              <div align="justify">The advantage of SOA is that it provides a very good architecture to achieve distributed processing. Service can easily plug and play. When the service stops, the system can search through the service directory to find the same type of service, achieving a HotSwap effect. But in reality, engineers have found that creating a system using SOA is not an easy task. The main reason is because SOA emphasizes on service orientation, but while we design systems, the focus is on compete features and goals. For example, every employee of a company is actually a service provider, assisting the company team in achieving a certain goal. But from a company's point of view, how to group these employees into a strong battle group to complete the task given to them is also as important as finding these people. This integration activity is actually an enterprise process or service oriented process (SOP). Thus, the Process Oriented Architecture (POA) concept is proposed to be used to integrate various services. Each service can also be composed of a chain processes. SOA focuses on the communication and management of components. But POA focuses on how to use these components to do something useful. </div></td>

When the service related protocols are standardized, it would result in an “Internet Effect”— more and more services appearing, and system creation does not start from zero; rather they would build on these existing services to be rapidly created, resulting in more demand for services that starts a positive circulation. </div></td>
