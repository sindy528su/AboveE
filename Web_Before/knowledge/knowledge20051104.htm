Yet, the world is flat, and the rules of the game change rapidly. Enterprises must be able to react swiftly when the environment changes to maintain its profits. These needs are making usage of IT solutions to support business operations ever more important. But out-of-the box enterprise applications software mainly focuses on satisfying the general needs of enterprises. On the other hand, internally developed systems are often designed based on the needs of when the system is being developed. In a time when differential management of business operations become more apparent, while waiting is a luxury that cannot be afforded, whether out-of-the box software or internally developed s systems, their flexibility and speed to adjust only becomes too slow to keep up the pace with the needs of enterprise. Therefore, for enterprises that need to have swift and flexible processes, building a new generation enterprise IT infrastructure based on the concepts of BPM has quickly become the trend. More and more enterprises are acknowledging the importance of BPM and are pondering how to deploy BPM systems. IT systems providers are also utilizing this opportunity by introducing BPM products. But for enterprises that are faced with numerous attractive products but are unfamiliar with the various marketing jargon, what type of BPM solutions is the best choice for enterprises? </p></td>

              <div align="justify">From my previous professional BPM service, I deeply feel that when enterprises are faced with today's challenges, the key to the solution is always whether each department can cooperate as a team. This is because for an enterprise to achieve each goal, efforts across multiple departments are needed. For the same reason, systems that deal with processes cannot avoid having features to support inter-department operations. Therefore, when determining the needs when selecting a BPM solution, both macro-needs and micro-needs have to be considered to gain a holistic understanding so that the best evaluation standard can be devised to select the most beneficial BPM solution for an enterprise. For example, when an enterprise is still not large, maybe a paperless and flexible office automation process is the best solution needed by the enterprise. But when considering the future growth target in 3 or 5 years, integration ability may be what is most needed. Also, when IT projects such as order management or other processes that involve multiple departments, completing the mission not only requires integrating existing ERP systems, but also during the process of establishing the system, the ability to get each department involved to work with the IT department in introducing the BPM concept and not try to shift responsibility to others when cooperation is the key to the success or failure of an order management BPM solution. Therefore, professional BPM deployment services have just become more important while the product itself is not the only factor. </div></td>

Professional services that are needed can also include deployment service, IT architecture planning service, process consulting service, and BPM project management service, to operation strategy consulting.

For example, a product that position itself to be an out-out-the box product will naturally emphasize its easy of use rather than its ability to adapt to various needs. It would also naturally be taking in process management and integration features and mechanisms. So these types are more suited for managing forms, such as office automation process. Products that offer a platform emphasizes on its openness and can support multiple and complex process logic, as well as various management needs. Even various mainstream front end human computer interface technology such as JSP and ASP enables enterprises to build information highway systems that connect various information sources with applications. Although various existing enterprise IT systems, regardless of ERP, CRM, SCM, portal, or custom designed operations can all add processes into the system to reinforce a high degree process based application system. </div></td>

Therefore, an error-tolerant and load balancing architecture is a must. Also, if simplifying the management of IT is a company goal, then a single management mechanism for the whole organization would be needed.

Since from a cost point of view, it would be expected that the development method match the skills roadmap of IT personnel and does not rely on proprietary languages for development. Since the current trend is different the past when only the convenience of coding is emphasized, now the matching of the IT architecture development with the technical skills of the personnel is most optimal for the enterprise, and is the consideration of modern IT managers. Also, the maintenance cost is mostly dependent on the number of features supported by the product and whether a healthy management mechanism exists. For example, in regards to supporting job assignment logic or process branching and confluence logic, if a product can provide a method to achieve them, it would be much clearer to display it on process diagrams, making maintenance much easier. From a management cost point of view, if maintaining every problem in the process would require taking a look at the code to solve problems, then when there are more and more systems, there wouldn't be anybody that would understand all the code, thus increase risks. On the other hand, it would render the management of the processes that the BPM system is suppose to manage unmanageable. Then the long term benefits of the BPM system cannot be realized, making it another problematic IT system. </div></td>

            <td><p align="justify"> My previous involvement with the BPM project at Wintech Microelectronics received a goal metal award that was never received by any other Asian software company. Applying BPM to create the benefits of process innovation is the key for us and our customer, Wintech Microelectronics, receiving the award and was selected by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) as the best 2004 Asian Pacific best case for the global industry and academia. This represents not only Taiwan 's software industry strength is already strong enough to compete at international levels, but this is also an example of never ending innovation of Taiwanese enterprises. Through my thoughts in the article, it is hopped that it can asset enterprises to make the BPM selection into a systematic process to truly select the best BPM solution that can help create long term benefits. </p></td>
