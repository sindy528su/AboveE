These terminologies used at various different marketing events may have been interpreted differently and given different meanings. So how to clarify their statuses? From my experience during the past few years in interacting with customers and servicing customers the BPM area, I would like to start by explaining BPM and SOA, and discuss the relationship and status of Web Services, BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation), and other related popular terminology. It is hoped that readers will not be confused and actually learn new concepts during the next seminar on a related topic. </p></td>

Starting from the IT architecture to resolve the massive resources needed to integrate different systems, the focus has been improving the limitations of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) private architecture. Building a new trans-technology distributed system can quickly integrate the required features together to satisfy the application demands. SOA has been leading the development of this approach. </div></td>

The focus is on bridging the gap between business and IT, with the goal of enabling IT to rapidly support the business objectives by forming a management mechanism with analyzable and rapidly adjustable processes. BPM has been the leading topic of this approach. </div></td>

Recent developments indicate that they have been supporting each other and moving closer together. Using building houses as an analogy, where BPM is a construction team with design plan while SOA is a modularized construction method, the first target is the build a good house, a house that is comfortable to live in. </div></td>

            <td><p align="justify"> When SOA was proposed in the 1990s, it was targeted at software design concepts and the architecture to integrate software. As a result, technologies such as CORBA, RMI, DCOM, and even technologies that utilize Sockets, can create systems that consist of SOA architecture. But under new definitions that places emphasis on loose coupling and technology neutral, SOA has gradually become an architecture and design concept based on standard network computing technologies. Its goal is to transform business functions into internet based services. Of course standard network computing technologies refers to SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and other technologies derived from security, information reliability, and related Web Services technology, such as WS-Reliable Messaging and WS-Security. Web Services has became one of the basic components in building SOA, currently most information discussing SOA are closely connected to Web Services. Yet, when extending up from SOA, information authorization and conversion, distribution of content based information, load balancing, and various configurations, deployments, and monitoring management mechanisms, are added. This resulted in the emergence of Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that surpasses the concept, technology, and architecture levels, replacing the old EAI system as the next generation Business Integration Platform. </p></td>

Since it is focused on management, its emphasis is on continual process management, and not a single one time perfect solution. Therefore, when introducing BPM into an organization, it not only needs the BPM based process systems, but more importantly is to introduce methods and consulting services, to enable enterprise users to correctly understand BPM concepts, enabling IT departments and enterprise users to jointly hold the responsibility of creating or improving process systems. As well, during inter-department cooperation, shifting responsibility should be strongly discouraged. </p></td>

The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is a technology created by a combination of WSFL and XLANG, initially proposed by IBM and Microsoft respectively, after Web Services became popular. BPEL provides a shared process execution language across BPM process engines. Since BPEL is based on the properties of Web Services, it enables enterprises that deploy BPM systems to quickly establish a SOA based IT architecture. </div></td>

But since WSFL and XLANG were initially focused on process automation standards, the BPEL that is based on the two technologies often would ignore supporting Human Workflow. Therefore, BPEL has a direct effect of strengthening SOA execution, but while still emphasizing on a BPEL based BPM system. Such a system does not provide sufficient flexibility in organization and job assignment. Or to makeup for deficiencies of workflow, many add proprietary extensions to standard BPEL definitions, rendering the cross process engines feature useless. </p></td>
