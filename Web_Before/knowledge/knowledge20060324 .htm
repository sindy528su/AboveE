But some enterprises only try to deal with the situation through the use of reporting systems and business intelligence tools. But the figures displayed by these tools only show the results and not the process. So users can know from these figures that idle material exist, but cannot understand what are causing the increase in idle material. Viewing this historic information to find the source of the sickness that is causing the increase in idle material is like drivers that only look at the rear mirror when driving, which is very dangerous. </div></td>

Even if features of each system are strengthened, if it is not supported by automated processes that can implement and execute the company's standard operating procedures (SOP), then it would still be difficult to resolve the idle material problem. For example, when there is a change in demand, not only the sales department need to make a decision on canceling the production of related products, the production department and purchasing personnel need to be notified immediately, to respectively stop production and cancel orders for unnecessary material. The whole process is connected and if any of the connections loosen or is delayed, then accumulation of idle material would be very likely. </div></td>

Therefore, even when manufacturers realize that process management is a solution to resolve the idle material problem, aside from deploying a BPM product, it still needs to have the ability to diagnose its problems.

              <div align="justify">Since the management of idle materials touches on many aspects, and are connected closely to the contingency decisions, so the pressure of time is very large. As well, it would rely on many information sources. So if users need to enter the needs one by one each time into the database, it would waste time and effort. There may also be thousands or tens of thousands of requirements that are simultaneously entered. This would drag system performance to a halt. Thus, to increase the effectiveness of controlling idle material, EAI integration ability of application systems, are skills that need to be mastered by MIS departments. </div></td>

              <div align="justify">For example, orders from customers often need to maintain consistency with Forecasted Orders (FCST), or otherwise, could easily result in redundant material preparation, resulting in idle materials. But the customer order and FCST are actually separated on different systems and are maintained by different professional teams, If a customer suddenly cancels an order, the enterprise not only has to stop production, but would also need to cancel the corresponding FCST entry. The longer the delay between actions, the larger amount of idle materials may be created. For businesses that utilize EAI and BPM technologies, the above steps are updated automatically, and there is no need to worry about problems resulting from human error or issues with coordinated operations. </div></td>

Or does it support automatic communication between different systems. Because different levels of integration would result in differences in the effectiveness of idle material management. </div></td>
