Yet, when companies grow in a fast pace, it is when management challenges start. Especially when global competitors and profits continue to be squeezed as well as with more complex and dynamic operating environments, the margin of error is continuously decreasing. The cost of making a mistake becomes higher. Also, over emphasis on sales volume and production capacity results in low awareness of cost, resulting in the idle storage of materials and semi-finished goods, which if increased too rapidly, would result in a cash flow crisis. An analysis of the product structure of manufacturers, over 80 percent of the costs are material costs, for network and communications products, over 90 percent of the costs are material costs. When the profits of the manufacturing industry continue to decreases, if the IT systems can be utilized, increasing effectiveness in managing materials is a good prescription for the business to survive at such as competitive era. Below are four major challenges from previous experiences in consulting BPM processes in the manufacturing industry: </p></td>

Yet, more and more changes in needs are a result of changes to orders. Such as during 2000~2001 when there was a global inventory problem, which occurred because of the over-optimistic belief in delays in taking delivery for orders was only a temporary phenomenon, while market demand has not decreased. It wasn't until when large quantities of orders were cancelled that resulted in serious overstocking of inventory that cannot be put to use and decreasing prices that result in losses. As well, competitors were marketing new products at increasing speeds, forcing product design to also have to quickly make changes. This resulted in changes in demand for components, so if research &amp; development and materials management cannot effectively resolve the issue, it would result in losses due to decreasing price or overstock inventory that cannot be put to use. </p></td>

If the system is distributed and cannot timely control the status of warehouses in each location, businesses will often lack effective integrated information and would blindly increase safety reserves or advance orders of raw materials to ensure a sable supply source, resulting in an increased stock level. Not to mention that due to the lack of information penetration when communicating with other companies in the supply chain could result in an echoing effect. </p></td>

When the economy is good, stocking more inventory and contracts promising purchasing quantities can avoid the risk of the lack of raw materials to ensure sufficient quantities of products are produced to respond market demand. But when the economy downturns, or when market demand was not as strong as expected, then it would result in surplus stock. </div></td>

              <div align="justify"><span class="t61">Lax Control of Product Change Processes:</span> In the manufacturing industry, Product / Engineering Change Notices (ECN) are very common. It is a result of many reasons, such as customers changing product type / increase new features; research and development department changing designs to increase product yield, purchasing substitute materials to reduce cost… etc. Basically a proper ECN Control process can avoid unnecessary inventory. Using changing the order as an example, if there is a lack of good order management policy, sales personnel or even newly admitted sales assistants can change orders whenever they see fit. Yet, the purchasing and materials management departments would only be alerted after the fact; then the loss resulting from overstock materials that won't be used were not evaluated before the change. Thus, there is no basis to request compensation from the customer. In the long run, these problems will reflect in the quantities of stocked items. </div></td>

Company A is an ODM/OEM manufacturer. It is located in an industry characterized by rapidly changing demands, short product lifecycles, and ever decreasing profit margins. To resolve the challenges it faces in this environment and increase profitability, the company's vice-president of finance discovered from quarterly financial reports that stock levels have a trend of being high. Through inter-organization and interdepartmental discussions, it was discovered that during the process of rapid growth for the company, it was focused on achieving sales figures and increasing production capacity. The standard operation processes vary in each location. Barriers exist between organizations, resulting in unclear responsibilities, creating many problems that result in unused stock inventory. The problems can be summarized as below: </p></td>

Also, through the monitoring and tracking ability of the process system, it can support long term goals such as continuous analysis and process improvements. Therefore, company A decided to introduce the BPM concept. Since the scope of the product strides across MIS, sales, materials management, production management, purchasing, research and development, and finance departments, therefore a professional BPM consultant with a proper introduction method can effectively resolve conflicts between departments, utilize resources across departments, and effectively and systematically introduce products to meet the expected goals. Through assistance from the external BPM consultants to complete the shared the vision and goals of the project, confirmed the required processes, and selected a person to be responsible for each process to assist with defining the process and interdepartmental negations.

Due to competition at a global scale, businesses are only left with a small profit margin. Then why not try another method, through controlling expenses. After all, “One more dollar of revenue does not equal one more dollar of profits (This is because there are costs and sales &amp; management fees associated with the increased revenue); but saving one more dollar can result in an additional one dollar increase in profit.” This article attempts to explain with a real case of how a manufacturing industry can apply BPM to achieve stock risk control and reduce unused materials. Hopefully the sharing of experience in saving costs would be beneficial to businesses. </p></td>
