But platform venders such as Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, or IBM have all released development tools for Web Services. Even application system venders, such as SAP, Seibel, and PeopleSoft have all introduced next generation application systems that are web services oriented. It cannot be denied that Web Services is the best method to implement SOA (Diagram 1) </p></td>

But in the past, faced with various different application systems used within enterprises, to actually deploy it would require significant resources to integrate existing resources. Also the development and connecting method are different for each system, so opening and sharing resources has been hard to realize. The rise of Web Services provides a standard open integration technology that provided a new source of energy for Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). With Web Services as the shared language of processes, such as IBM's WSFL and Microsoft's XLANG, which were subsequently combined to create the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), which is aiming to become the standard BPMS supported language. </p></td>

Therefore, to establish the structure of SOA, the first step is to analyze which features in each application system need to be converted into services. The general intuitive method is to check which features appear to repeat in each system, then use this as a basis to decide which features should be converted into services. Another method is starting from the process, through cooperation between the IT and business departments; carefully locate and analyze the individual steps of the processes to on one hand determine which features need to be converted into services from the practical needs of processes.

Through programming tools (IDE), such as JBuilder, IBM WSAD, or .Net Studio, convert these interfaces into Web Services. Then generate the WSDL service description method. Next, by using BPMS process design tools to configure each of the services as steps within a process and then linking the processes together create a Web Service Capable BPMS, and can release the design processes as Web Services that provide process services consisting of complex logic. </p></td>

But by not deploying BPM to link Business and IT personnel to work toward a common goal, finding the correct matters, and implementing it at the IT level to make the execution process more effective. Otherwise, when Business and IT each does it own thing, they would often have the wrong goals, and cannot make things more efficient, while wasting company resource. So even if SOA is introduced, the results of would only be limited to convenient IT systems integration. </p></td>
