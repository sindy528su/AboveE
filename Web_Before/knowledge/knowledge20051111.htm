Whether it is in manufacturing, product strategy, sales, or customer service. The role of IT has become even more important.

            <td><p align="justify"> According to research results from Gartner, by the year 2005, more than 90% of large enterprises would have introduced the BPM system into their organization. At the same time, iThome Computer Paper reported in its “2005 Survey of IT Purchases by the Top 2000 Companies in Taiwan” that “…enterprises that are introducing work processes or BPM projects or are planning to, make up a large portion of the surveyed enterprises, 24.5% and 27% respectively”. Therefore it can be seen that the BPM concept and solution has been gradually accepted by both domestic and foreign enterprises. Yet, the same as introducing ERP, SCM, CRM, KM, and other enterprise information systems, when introducing BPMS, businesses must face the organizational (such as changes in the daily operation processes) and technology impacts. Therefore, whether the organization is able to adapt is key to the success or failure of the project introduction. Also, interdepartmental cooperation is an important characteristic of BPM projects. As such, from the usability of the platform, as well as the start, execution, finish, and benefit evaluation of the project all require experienced service providers and enterprise IT departments, as well as close cooperation of each operations department to ensure the BPM product can be correct and effectively utilized. Tight controls of the project and process optimization all have their reasons that finally result in the goals of the enterprise. Must businesses do not understand how to introduce BPMS and run BPM projects; therefore, there is need to utilize the professional knowledge and services of BPM consultants to assist with each level of introduction.
