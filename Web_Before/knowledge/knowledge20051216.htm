As mentioned by Jim Collins, author of “from A to A+”, the strategy of outstanding enterprises is to continuously infuse the company with new talent and eliminate unsuitable personnel so the enterprise can develop a bright future and find its new direction, new vision, and new strategy. Therefore in an information age, enterprises must transform human resource management processes to electronic processes. Only after digitizing the information of people would it be possible to develop and utilize human resources and to strengthen the value of human productivity. In other words, the mission of human resource departments must expand from just routine work, such as recording absence, and calculating and distributing salary, to being able to maintain up-to-date and timely information about personnel. This information can then be applied and circulated with enterprise competitive strategy. The largest challenge facing these changes is how to use the least amount of resources to complete more work and using the complete and analyzed information as basis to plan human resource strategy. Therefore, enterprise personnel lifecycle management has become more important and after analysis consists of the following: management of the human resource budget, application to increase or decrease personnel, recruiting personnel, hiring of personnel, evaluation of personnel during the trial period, personnel adjustments, leave without pay, and termination application processes. Aside from maintaining basic employee information, information should be maintained on the company assets held by each personnel, system access rights must also be adjusted when there are personnel adjustments, and must need to synchronize data other companies. There may also even be need to generate strategic information reports to satisfy the needs of senior management. </p></td>

Therefore, it can support future benefit analysis and integrate information from existing information assets while re-enforcing approval information contents.
