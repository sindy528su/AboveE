Using Wintech Microelectronics as an example, when faced with the industry environment of lower profit margins, higher product turnover rates, and shortened lifecycles, Wintech Microelectronics must expand the scope of its business operations to lower management and marketing fees, increase the level of technology, increase technology support with upstream IC design semiconductor venders and downstream system venders, increase product turnover rates, and continue to add more product types to increase the company's profits. </p></td>

When expanding globally, many operation problems would start to appear. The first problem that needs to be faced is the increased difficulty of financial management: IC distributors have a capital intensive industry cost structure. As the organization continues to grow in size, goods in stock and accounts receivable increases. When this unfolds, how to appropriately and soundly operate its financial operations to ensure capital is being put to good use is an issue that Wintech Microelectronics must seriously consider. Also, faced with a global marketplace, Wintech Microelectronics personnel must travel on business trips around the world to maintain close relationships with customer and grasp the new industry and market trends. When this occurs, managing and utilizing human resources around the global marketplace is a problem. Aside from this, having a flexible logistics and dispatchment system: such as how to efficiently dispatching products / inventory at various locations in the most cost effective and correct manner, in correct quantities to the correct location and the right time? Last, how to coordinate operations on a global scale: Global professional division of labor forces enterprises to be able to coordinate supply / demand chains across regions and across many organizations. This results in process management having to extend externally. Such a large and complex organization relation cannot be efficiently managed without proper integration with information systems. </p></td>

Then in 2001, Wintech Microelectronics started a comprehensive deployment of SAP ERP. Originally, Wintech Microelectronics used different ERP systems at each location. But as the size of the enterprise grew, integrating systems became more complex. Deploying SAP ERP indeed solved many organization coordination problems in its global operations.

Externally, it needs to maintain a good relationship with its upstream and downstream partners and customers to effectively grasp the latest market trends and product dynamics. Therefore the new electronic process solution needs to meet the needs of Wintech Microelectronics, flexibility to adjust to the whole enterprise process, and appropriately respond to exceptional events that may occur. Furthermore, since SAP ERP can also support Wintech Microelectronics' multiple organization / location structure, then the new information system needs to be able to seamlessly integrate with existing ERP and other legacy systems. After detailed analysis, Wintech Microelectronics selected AboveE, a professional BPM vender, to assist with solving many of the issues above.

              <div align="justify">Managing an enterprise was never an easy task. Especially when faced with an ever changing and treacherous business environment. The amount of time that enterprises have to respond to changes in the environment is becoming shorter! This is when enterprises must make appropriate investments in information technology to use tools in assisting execution of tasks or polices in order to convert strategy to competitiveness; making steady inroads into the small group of outstanding successful enterprises. The Wintech Microelectronics mentioned in this article is an example of such company to construct and utilize an information platform to support its enterprise operations in the wave of globalization. </div></td>
